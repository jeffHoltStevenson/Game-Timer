This is a ChatGPT experiement of a game timer. 

I built one of these a long ago for the first iPhone. 
That project was in Objective C and was much more painful to build and publish than this little experiement.
For this project, I did have to fix some defects in the generated code. For the most part, it was pretty simple to create and push to my phone.
